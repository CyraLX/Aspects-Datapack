# Aspects — Strike the deal, reveal your potential

> **Harvest the creatures of this world to become something more.**  
> Unlock powerful abilities by absorbing the essence of creatures and choosing your **Aspect**. Whether you want to soar like an Elytrian or become one with the darkness like a Rascal, this mod lets you rewrite your nature.

This datapack is inspired by the [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) mod that introduces unique Aspects, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages.

## Version specifics
Requirements:

- Minecraft 1.21.5+

Optional

- None

## Features

### Aspects
Each Aspect grants:
- **Aspect Effects** (passive traits)
- **Focus Powers** (active abilities you can trigger with unique Focus items)

## Essence System

Harness the **Essences** of mobs to forge a new **Aspect**:
- Each mob has 1–3 Essences (like `Aquatic`, `Fire`, `Undead`, etc.)
- Use the **Essence Extractor** to collect them, or just kill them, that works too
- Store them in an **Essence Cage**
- Combine specific Essences to awaken an **Aspect**

<details>
<summary>Essence Combinations</summary>
  
> Essence Combinations can also just be a singular Essences, like **Human** below.
> <br>Essences add up to 120 total regardless of amount of Essence Types.
> <br>So 1 Essence type means it takes 120 to create an aspect, 2 types means its a 60/60 split, 3 means 40/40/40 split, etc...

- `Humanoid` → **Human**
- `Aquatic` → **Merling**
- `Void` + `Humanoid` → **Enderian**
- `Bug` + `Plant` → **Honey Bee**
- ...

*(Full combination list available in-game or on the Wiki soon)*

## FAQ

### How to change my Aspect after the first one?

1. Craft an **Essence Cage** (optionally an **Essence Extractor** too)
2. Kill or extract mobs to gather Essences
3. Store enough Essences to create an **Awakened Essence Cage**
4. Consume the **Awakened Essence Cage** to choose your new Aspect

### My Mods button is overlapping the Aspects button in the Pause Menu!

This issue can be the fault of the Mod Menu (Fabric) mod itself, you can fix it by going into the Mod Menu settings and changing **Game Menu** option to anything else, except for **insert**.

### Can I add new Aspects myself?

Yes, the datapack allows new Aspects via add-on datapacks, although it’s not as easy as we’d like.

A guide will be made available soon on the project’s GitHub page.
